Reading data from a file

```{r}
#file = 'http://openmv.net/file/food-texture.csv'
file = 'food-texture.csv'
#the csv file should be in the same directory as the code file
foodData = read.csv(file, header = TRUE, row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 
```

In-built functions on the data frame that has been read

```{r}
# Get dimension
dim(foodData)

# Get number of rows and columns
nrow(foodData)
ncol(foodData)

# Structure of the data frame
str(foodData)

# In-built functions that can applied to columns of a data frame
mean(foodData$Density)
mean(foodData[['Density']])
apply(foodData, 2, mean)
apply(foodData[c('Oil', 'Density')], 2 , mean)
```
